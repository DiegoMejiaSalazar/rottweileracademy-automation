  As a student
  I want to be able to log out
  to prevent third parties from changing my personal information or performing improper activities with my profile.

  Scenario: Logout given a user that logged in
    Given I have accessed to the rottweiler academy page
    When I select the option Iniciar Sesi칩n
    And I have put "diego.mejia@ucb.edu.bo" in the field of direccion de correo electr칩nico
